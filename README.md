# Exercise 1 - Elevator Problem

- In this exercise we will try to figure out the best algorithm for 
  an elevators , which use smart panel calls the user will press
  the desired floor and the elevator system will figure our the way
  to distribute every user to its desired floor with the minimum time
  possible (total time and individual user time)
